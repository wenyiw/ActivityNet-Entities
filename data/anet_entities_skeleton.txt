Format of JSON ActivityNet-Entities annotation files

### for anet_entities_trainval.json
-> database
  -> [video name]: identifier of video
    - rwidth: resized width of video, will be 720px
    - rheight: resized height of video, maintains aspect ratio
    -> segments
      -> [segment id]: segment from video with bounding box annotations
        -> objects
          -> [object number]: annotated object from segment
            -> noun_phrases: a list of noun phrase (NP) annotations of the object, both the text and the index of the word in the sentence
            - frame_ind: frame index (0-9, we divide each video evenly into 10 clips and sample the middle frame of each clip)
            - ybr: y coordinate of bottom right corner of bounding box
            - ytl: y coordinate of top left corner of bounding box
            - xbr: x coordinate of bottom right corner of bounding box
            - xtl: x coordinate of top left corner of bounding box
            - crowds: whether the box represents a group of objects


### for anet_entities_cleaned_class_thresh50_trainval.json
-> vocab: the 431 object classes (not including the background class)
-> annotations
  -> [video name]: identifier of video
    -> segments
      -> [segment id]: segment from video with bounding box annotations
        -> process_clss: object class of all the bounding boxes
        -> tokens: tokenized sentence
        -> frame_ind: frame index of all the bounding boxes
        -> process_idx: the index of the object class in the sentence
        -> process_bnd_box: coordinate of all the bounding boxes
        -> crowds: whether the box represents a group of objects
        
Submissions need to be named submission_gt for ground truth mode and submission_gen for generated sentences mode.
